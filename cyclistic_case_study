I will be analyzing real world data from the bikeshare company, Divvy, based in Chicago, using their 2023 ride data. The datasets are publically available [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) (The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)). With over 5 million total rows, I will be using R to handle the large dataset rather than a spreadsheet.\n\n## Scenario\n\nCyclistic is a (fictional) bikeshare company in Chicago with two types of customers: **annual members** that pay an annual fee for unlimited rides throughout the year and **casual riders** who pay either per ride or per day. The Cyclistic marketing analytics team is looking to convert casual riders into annual members as the latter are deemed to be much more profitable and they believe that converting casual riders is a better strategy than targeting all-new customers.\n\nMy objective is to analyze the data to answer three key questions:\n\n1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Environment Set-Up","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load the packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\noptions(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-07T19:26:21.008158Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-07T19:26:21.010761Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-07T19:26:21.422417Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

Tableau Visualizations\n\nNow that we've migrated our data from RStudio to Tableau, we can create cleaner and more descriptive visualizations. I've compiled all of the above viz data into an interactive [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joshua.mercado2815/viz/CyclisticCaseStudy_17138915127790/CyclisticBikeshareDatabyCustomerType2023) that allows users to highlight the data by customer type:\n\n<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1715283208917' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Cyclistic Bikeshare Data by Customer Type 2023 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cy&#47;CyclisticCaseStudy_17138915127790&#47;CyclisticBikeshareDatabyCustomerType2023&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='CyclisticCaseStudy_17138915127790&#47;CyclisticBikeshareDatabyCustomerType2023' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cy&#47;CyclisticCaseStudy_17138915127790&#47;CyclisticBikeshareDatabyCustomerType2023&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1715283208917');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='1827px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>\n\n## Key Metrics: Total Rides, Average Ride Length, and Total Ride Length\n\nThis single viz reiterates the previous observations that **annual members** ride nearly *twice as often* as **casual riders**, but spend *nearly half the time per ride on average*. These two metrics combined show that the total time spent on bikes is *nearly equal between the two customer types*.\n\n## Popular [Docking] Stations\n\nWhile the map is slightly cluttered due to the density of docking stations, we can still see a clear trend of **casual riders** starting their trips closer to the downtown/shoreline area, further suggesting that casual rides are generally for leisure/sightseeing. We do have the ability to zoom in and see that **Annual members** have some very dense clusters near universities and hospitals. We can infer that *students and hospital workers would serve as a great demographic to target for conversion to annual membership.*\n\n## Daily Rides and Average Daily Ride Length\n\nThese are the same visualizations that we created in RStudio earlier, recreated here for a complete picture.\n\n## Hourly Rides and Hourly Ride Lengths on **weekends**\n\nThe hourly data from the weekends show that **annual members** spend pretty much the same amount of time on their rides no matter the time of day, while **casual riders** extend their ride time as the morning progresses, peaking in the early afternoon, and then gradually declining for the rest of the day. **Annual members** are taking \"inelastic\" rides, meaning that *their ride length is not governed by the time of day*. We can infer that this is because *their rides are objective based rather than for leisure*, as is shown in the **casual riders'** \"elastic\" ride length curve. \n\n## Hourly Rides Lengths **weekdays**:\n\nThe hourly data from weekdays shows extremely clear peaks during the traditional \"rush hour\" periods, which all but confirms *a significant percentage of annual members draw their value from being able to use Cyclistic bikes for commuting purposes*.\n\n# 6. Conclusion\n\n### As a reminder, the business task was to answer three specific questions:\n\n1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n\n**How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**\n\n|Casual Riders|Annual Members|\n|------|------|\n|Ride longer on average|Annual members ride more often|\n|Bike usage spikes in the afternoon, regardless of day|Bike usage spikes during weekday rush hour commutes|\n|Tend to start their rides near downtown or shoreside locations|Tend to start their rides near medical centers and universities|\n|Average ride lengths are highly determined by the time of day|Average ride lengths are fairly static regardless of the time of day|\n\n**Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?**\n\nThe easier question to ask is why wouldn't a casual rider buy a Cyclistic annual membership? The simple answer is value. We can infer that many casual rides are taken by tourists or infrequent sightseers, and are therefore very unlikely to glean value from an annual membership. The casual riders that would make up the target segment for annual memberships are customers whose behavior mimics all or even part of the behavior of annual members: purpose driven, frequent rides between regular docking stations, including frequent rides during peak commuting times. Without individual user data, it is hard for me to identify that customer segment, but if I were working for the real life company with access to that data, then it would be a simple matter of isolating the top percentage of casual riders that match any aspect of that behavior.\n\n**How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?**\n\nDigital media is an incredibly powerful marketing tool when combined with high level, data driven insights like the ones that we've gleaned above.\n* A monthly and/or annual \"wrapped\" statistics summary could prove useful to point out to casual riders how their riding habits could benefit from an annual membership. This could also incentivize less frequent riders to try and augment their riding numbers when contextualized by carbon offsets or \"adventure\" styled marketing (e.g. \"You rode X miles last month! That's like biking the length of X\"). Top casual riders could also be presented with an opportunity for a discounted first year membership, thereby gamifying rides.\n* Digital advertisements or even discount codes through tactical partnerships with hospitals and universities would effectively target a population that has demonstrated its outsized use of Cyclistic bikes with the goal of Cyclistic bikes being the de facto mode of transportation for patrons of those institutions.\n* Not necessarily a digital media form of marketing, but advertisements targeting non-cycling commuting avenues can present Cyclistic as a more fun, possibly more eco friendly option for commuting. This could include high traffic streets, congested subway stations, and popular walking paths.\n\n### Thanks for taking the time to read all of this! If you've made it this far, you might be:\n* considering me for a job position (thank you again for your time and consideration)\n* my mom, incredibly proud of her son's work (whether it be macaroni art or data analysis)\n* super interested in Chicago bikeshare data and/or data cleaning!
