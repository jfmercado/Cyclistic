# Cyclistic Case Study

This repository contains markdown writeups (one using SQL and one using R) that detail my exploration, cleaning, transformation, and analyzation of real world bikeshare data in order to inform marketing strategies of the fictional bikeshare company, Cyclistic.

The Tableau dashboard used in both processes can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CyclisticCaseStudy_17138915127790/CyclisticBikeshareDatabyCustomerType2023?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
